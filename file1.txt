Created new text file


How to upload any local or network files with Load runner scripting:
 There are several options that do the same work:

Running test locally :
Record script where you upload a local file. I suggest placing file in “C:\temp” before recording. 
Run the test using same local machines. Test will pass since script and upload file both located in the same machine during recording and test execution. 
Keep in mind to replace single backslash with double backslashes in the script. Here is the sample script:
web_submit_data("AddAttachment.aspx",
 "Action=https://learningshared.com/AddAttachment.aspx",
 "Method=POST",
 "EncType=multipart/form-data",
 "RecContentType=text/html",
 "Snapshot=t7.inf",
 "Mode=HTML",
 ITEMDATA,
     "Name=__VIEWSTATE", "Value={ViewState_Value_1}", ENDITEM,
     "Name=__EVENTVALIDATION", "Value={EVENTVALIDATION_1}", ENDITEM,
     "Name=FileUpload1", "Value=C:\\Temp\\my_uploaded_file.pdf", "File=yes", ENDITEM,
     "Name=Button1", "Value=Upload", ENDITEM,
 LAST);

Running test with any network load generator:This method is similar to the first method. Therefore, record the script the same way as above. 
Create a network share location with read & write access. Place files those need to be uploaded. 
Replace local file location with network file location. Make sure to replace single backslash with double backslashes in the script. Here is the sample script:
web_submit_data("AddAttachment.aspx",
 "Action=https://learningshared.com/AddAttachment.aspx",
 "Method=POST",
 "EncType=multipart/form-data",
 "RecContentType=text/html",
 "Snapshot=t7.inf",
 "Mode=HTML",
 ITEMDATA,
     "Name=__VIEWSTATE", "Value={ViewState_Value_1}", ENDITEM,
     "Name=__EVENTVALIDATION", "Value={EVENTVALIDATION_1}", ENDITEM,
     "Name=FileUpload1", "Value=\\\\shared_network_location\\my_uploaded_file.pdf", "File=yes", ENDITEM,
     "Name=Button1", "Value=Upload", ENDITEM,
 LAST);

 Attach upload file with scripts:
This method is similar to the first method. Record the script with a local file.
Add all the files (to be uploaded) to scripts by clicking “Add Files to Scripts…” menu from “Files -> Add Files to Scripts…”
Now clear file location and just leave the file name. These scripts should run from any load generators in the network or can be run from Performance center ALM too.
web_submit_data("AddAttachment.aspx",
 "Action=https://learningshared.com/AddAttachment.aspx",
 "Method=POST",
 "EncType=multipart/form-data",
 "RecContentType=text/html",
 "Snapshot=t7.inf",
 "Mode=HTML",
 ITEMDATA,
     "Name=__VIEWSTATE", "Value={ViewState_Value_1}", ENDITEM,
     "Name=__EVENTVALIDATION", "Value={EVENTVALIDATION_1}", ENDITEM,
     "Name=FileUpload1", "Value=my_uploaded_file.pdf", "File=yes", ENDITEM,
     "Name=Button1", "Value=Upload", ENDITEM,
 LAST);
